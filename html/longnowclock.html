      <h1>The Clock of the Long Now</h1>
      <p>
        A monument scale mechanical clock, built inside a mountain, designed to keep accurate time for the next ten
        millennia.
      <p>
      <div class="opener">Summary</div>
    </div>
    <div class="expanded">
      <div class="content display">
        <p>The Clock is hundreds of feet tall, engineered to require minimal maintenance, and powered by
          mechanical
          energy harvested from sunlight as well as the people that visit it.
        </p>
        <figure class="background-reveal">

          <figcaption>The winding platform, viewed from above</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The Clock will mark time with astronomic and calendric displays and a chime generator designed with the help
          of Brian Eno that can produce over 3.5 million unique bell chime
          sequences — one for every day the Clock is visited for the next 10,000 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ten thousand years is about the age of modern civilization, so The Clock will measure out a future of
          civilization
          equal to its past. This assumes our civilization is in the middle of whatever journey we are on — an
          implicit
          statement of optimism.
        </p>
        <p>
          To see The Clock you need to start at dawn, like any pilgrimage. It will require a day’s hike to reach
          its
          interior gears.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is still being assembled, deep inside a mountain, in West Texas.

            <p>
              Why would anyone build a Clock inside a mountain with the hope that it will ring for 10,000 years?
            </p>
            <p>Part of the
              answer: just so people will ask this question, and having asked it, prompt themselves to conjure with
              notions
              of generations and millennia. If you have a Clock ticking for 10,000 years what kinds of
              generational-scale
              questions and projects will it suggest? If a Clock can keep going for ten millennia, shouldn’t we make
              sure
              our civilization does as well? If The Clock keeps going after we are personally long dead, why not attempt
              other projects that require future generations to finish?

            <p>
              Ten thousand years — the life span I hope for The Clock — is about as long as the history of human
              technology.
              We have fragments of pots that old. Geologically, it's a blink of an eye. When you start thinking about
              building something that lasts that long, the real problem is not decay and corrosion, or even the power
              source. The real problem is people. If something becomes unimportant to people, it gets scrapped for
              parts;
              if
              it becomes important, it turns into a symbol and must eventually be destroyed. The only way to survive
              over
              the long run is to be made of materials large and worthless, like Stonehenge and the Pyramids, or to
              become
              lost.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>
                Just as Stonehenge and the Pyramids help us imagine our long past, The Clock invites us to image our
                long future.

              Civilization is revving itself into a pathologically short attention span. The trend might be coming from
              the
              acceleration of technology, the short-horizon perspective of market-driven economics, the next-election
              perspective of democracies, or the distractions of personal multi-tasking. All are on the increase. Some
              sort
              of balancing corrective to the short-sightedness is needed — some mechanism or myth which encourages the
              long
              view and the taking of long-term responsibility, where 'long-term' is measured at least in centuries.

              It would be charismatic to visit, interesting to think about, and famous enough to become iconic in the
              public discourse. Ideally, it would do for thinking about time what the photographs of Earth from space
              have
              done for thinking about the environment. Such icons reframe the way people think.

        How do you build a clock that will tick for 10,000 years?</h1>

        It’s one thing for a monument to endure for ten millennia, but The Clock also has to keep accurate time.

          Over ten thousand years, performing even the most basic functions of a clock: gathering energy, keeping
          time,
          and converting it into a meaningful display, becomes interestingly complex. As The Clock’s inventor Danny
          Hillis considered each of these functions, a set of design principles emerged which are generally useful to
          consider when designing anything to last a long time:

          <figcaption>Looking down the shaft at the mechanism below</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>The Mechanism</h2>
        <p>
          The Clock is entirely mechanical, made of long-lasting materials, including titanium, ceramics, quartz,
          sapphire, and 316 stainless steel. Even the most accurate mechanical clocks eventually drift off of the
          correct time, so The Clock synchronizes with the noontime sun. The Clock counts oscillations of the pendulum
          for
          day to day time, sunlight falling on the solar synchronizer to account for long-term drift, and a precomputed
          correction to solar time to accommodate for the orbital and rotational changes of Earth (rendered by the
          iconic Equation of Time Cam). Outputs include a
          depiction
          of the sky in the form of an orrery, a display of the Gregorian calendar date, and the chimes. Here’s how
          the
          pieces come together:
        </p>

        <div class="clock-diagram">
          <div class="clock-diagram-synchronizer">
            <h4>Solar synchronizer</h4>
            <p>
              Sunlight enters the mountain through a south facing <span class="synchronizer-color">synthetic sapphire
                window</span>, heating up a chamber of
              air,
              which moves a graphite cylinder. This movement synchronizes the timing system to solar noon, critical
              for
              maintaining long-term timekeeping accuracy. It also provides enough winding force to keep the pendulum
              ticking without human intervention.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="clock-diagram-timing">
            <h4>Timing system & displays</h4>
            <p>
              Energy from the <span class="synchronizer-color">solar synchronizer</span> above or the power system
              below
              is fed into an escapement that powers a
              slow moving titanium pendulum. This timing system is kept from drifting by corrections from the solar
              synchronizer and the Equation of Time Cam. The timing system is connected to a series of displays made
              up
              of dials and mechanical calendars. Visitors wind a wheel to advance the dials, which stops
              when it reaches the present moment. The Clock always knows what time it is, but only shows you when you
              wind it. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="clock-diagram-chimes">
            <h4>Chime generator & chimes</h4>
            <p>
              The <span class="chimes-color">chime generator</span> is a mechanical computer that rings ten bells in a
              different order each day someone winds The Clock for 10,000 years. The generator is made up of a cascading
              series of Geneva wheels which create intermittent motion
              (a
              bell ring) out of continuous rotation (from the power system).

              When the chimes are ringing, a geared <span class="governor-color">speed governor</span> spins up and
              moderates energy coming out of the power
              system.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="clock-diagram-winder">
            <h4>Power system & clock winder</h4>
            <p>
              The <span class="winder-color">main winder</span> is made up of an enormous capstan that visitors can spin
              to wind The Clock. Both the main winder and the solar winder store power in a large weight hanging from a
              rack gear. The power from this system is used to power the Clock and ring the chimes on any day that The
              Clock is fully wound. The rest of the time, any energy remaining after powering the time-keeping mechanism
              is stored, ensuring that The Clock can run for many years without sunlight or human winding.
            </p>
          </div>

        </div>

        <h2>The Journey</h2>
        <p>
          A visit to The Clock begins several hours before you reach the main winder. Just reaching the entrance tunnel,
          situated 1,500 feet above the high scrub desert, will leave some visitors out of breath, nicked by thorns, and
          wondering what they got themselves into. Once you enter the underground space , you will eventually encounter
          a set of metal doors. These act as a kind of crude airlock, keeping out dust and wild animals. Once through
          the doors you head into the darkness of a long tunnel. At the end, there’s the mildest hint of light ahead
          that you slowly find your way to. You look up. There is a faint light filtering down to you through giant
          gears illuminating the beginning of a spiral staircase.
        </p>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2oWTk4khvg" title="YouTube video player"

          allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
          allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>
          You start climbing the staircase, winding up the outer rim of the tunnel, rising toward the gears and faint
          light overhead. The stairs are carved out of the rock. To cut the spiral staircase, a special stone cutting
          robot was invented, which crept downward from the top of the shaft, grinding out a few stairs per day for
          nearly two years.
          After climbing about 100 feet, the first clock part you encounter is the driveweight of The Clock’s
          power system. This is a large bronze egg filled with concrete, about the size of a small car, and weighing
          10,000 pounds.
        </p>

        <p>
          After you pass the weights, you arrive at a winding station. It is a horizontal windlass or capstan, like one
          that might raise the anchor of an old sailing ship. It takes two or three visitors to turn the capstan easily
          and slowly lift its 10,000-pound weight. Together you spin the winder until the weight reaches the top of its
          travel beneath your feet.
        </p>

        <p>
          You keep climbing, past a multitude of giant gears, some over 8 feet in diameter and weighing 1,000 pounds.
          And past those you start to see large Geneva wheels that form the chime generator. This mechanical computer
          uses a progressive algorithm to determine which of the millions of possible sequences the chimes will play on
          a given day. The chimes will not repeat for over 10,000 years. This is the world’s slowest computer.
        </p>

        <p>
          On days when visitors are there to wind it, the calculated sequence rings each of the ten bells.
        </p>

          Fellow traveler and musician Brian Eno named the organization The Long Now Foundation to indicate the
          expanded
          sense of time The Clock provokes — not the short now of next quarter, next week, or the next five minutes,
          but
          the “long now” of centuries. Eno also worked with Danny Hillis on the chime generator’s progressive algorithm.
          His album, January 07003: Bell Studies for The Clock of the Long Now, provides a preview of the chimes that
          will ring inside the mountain over the millenia.

          “When we started thinking about The Clock, we naturally wondered what kind of sound it could make to announce the passage of time. I had nurtured an interest in bells for many years, and this seemed like a good alibi for taking it a bit deeper.”
        </div>
    </div>

        <p>
          The Clock always knows the correct time, but to save energy, it won’t update its display dials unless a
          visitor is present to provide the necessary power. Another hand-turned wheel awaits your effort. This one
          winds more easily — moving display dials requires less power than ringing bells. As you wind, the calendar
          wheels whirr until it stops and it shows the current date and orientation to the heavens.

        <p>
          The timing system sits at the center of the chamber. The pendulum and escapement are encased in a shield of
          brass and quartz glass to keep out dust, air movements, and critters. The pendulum, which governs the timing
          of The Clock, is a 6-foot long titanium assembly terminating with football-sized titanium weights. It swings
          at a satisfyingly slow 7-second period. The slight clicks of its escapement can just be heard in the silence
          of the mountain.
        </p>

        <p>
          So how does The Clock keep going if no one visits it for months, or years, or perhaps decades to wind it? A
          pathway continues up to the outside summit of the mountain and you can see the answer. That faint light seen
          from the bottom has resolved into a 12 foot cupola with a sapphire glass window covering the top of the shaft.
          This and a partially buried cylinder are the only parts of the clock visible from the outside. Sunlight enters
          the cupola and is focused down into the solar synchronizer, heating up a chamber of air which can be harvested
          as a mechanical signal for solar noon. This signal is adjusted by the Equation of Time Cam, which accounts for
          the +/- 15 minute difference of solar-to-absolute-time due to the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit (and a few
          other slow effects like the precessional cycle and rotational speed). </p>

        <p>
          Thermal power has been used for small mantel clocks before, but it has not been done before at this scale.
          As
          long as the sun shines and night comes, The Clock can keep time by itself, but it can’t ring its chimes for
          long or show the time it knows without visitors.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is more than just technology in the mountain. The ticks of time are a very human invention. Astronomical
          calendars are among the first relics of culture, and often the mark of civilizations. The Clock in the
          mountain not only plays the music of an ever-changing slow melody, but it will collect cultural expressions of
          time, ticks to mark the passage of decades and centuries. Off to the side of the main cavern of The Clock are
          a series of small niches to explore and collect these notices of time. Their contents will be a surprise.
        </p>

        <p>
          The journey to The Clock in the mountain ends on the summit in light. It is the sun that powers its ringing
          below. Like a heart beating while we sleep, The Clock in the mountain keeps time even when we pretend the
          past
          did not happen and the future will not come.
        </p>


        <h2>The Challenge</h2>

        <p>
          Almost any kind of artifact can last 10 millennia if stored and cared for properly. We have examples of
          5,000-year-old wood staves, papyrus, and leather sandals. On the other hand, modern metal can corrode in a few
          years of salt and rain. For longevity, the environment is often more important than material. The mountain top
          in Texas is a high dry desert, and in The Clock shaft below, the temperature is a stable 55 degrees fahrenheit
          regardless of time or season. This avoids freeze and thaw cycles, which can be as corrosive as water. It’s an
          ideal world for a ceaseless Clock.
        </p>

        <p>
          Still, The Clock is a machine with moving parts, and parts wear down and lubricants evaporate or corrode. Most
          of The Clock will be made in a marine grade 316 stainless steel. One of the main worries of the Clockmakers is
          that elements of a 10,000 year Clock — by definition — will move slowly. The millennial dial creeps so slowly
          it can be said to not move at all during your lifetime. Metals in contact with each other over those time
          scales can fuse — defeating the whole purpose of an ongoing timepiece. Dissimilar metals in contact can eat
          each other in galvanic corrosion. To counteract these tendencies, all of The Clock’s bearings are ceramic.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ceramics will outlast most metals as they can be diamond hard and do not corrode or rust. We have found shards
          of clay pots over 17,000 years old. Because these engineered ceramic bearings are so hard, and rotate at very
          low speed, they require no grit-attracting lubrication.
        </p>

        <p>
          The biggest problem for the beating Clock will be the effects of its human visitors. Over the span of
          centuries, valuable stuff of any type tends to be stolen, kids climb everywhere, and hackers naturally try to
          see how things work or break. But it is humans that keep The Clock’s bells wound up, and humans who ask it the
          time. The Clock needs us. It will be a long, out of the way journey to get inside The Clock ringing inside a
          mountain. But as long as The Clock ticks, it keeps asking us, in whispers of buried bells, “Are we being good
          ancestors?”

        In 02024, <a href="https://longnow.org/clock-faq/">Danny Hillis answered frequently asked questions</a> about
        The
        Clock.</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        In 02022, the bells of The Clock pealed for the first time. This footage is from the new documentary <i><a
            href="https://weareasgods.film/">We Are As Gods</a></i>, which explores the many legacies of Long Now
        co-founder
        Stewart Brand.

      <p>
        In 02018, with underground excavation complete, the first enormous timekeeping components were assembled
        underground, including the drive weight, winder and main gearing.
