Source Code
-----------

Files exist in versions compressed with gzip (.gz) and with bzip2 (.bz2).

zsh.tar.gz, zsh.tar.bz2
   Latest production release of zsh.  Includes the source files of all
   documentation.

zsh-dev.tar.gz, zsh-dev.tar.bz2
   The current development version of zsh.  Not guaranteed to be stable.
   If there is no such file, the latest version of the shell is the
   production release.

zsh-*.tar.gz,m zsh-*.tar.bz2
   Specific zsh versions.  If you just want the latest zsh then use
   zsh.tar.gz or zsh-dev.tar.gz or the .bz2 equivalents.  Only the
   latest production and (maybe) development release are in the top
   level directory; older versions are in the "old" directory.

old/*
   Older zsh versions.  Of historical interest only.

development/zsh-*.tar.gz, development/zsh-*.tar.bz2
   Versions of zsh for testing by zsh enthusiasts.  You are welcome to
   try this --- and in particular if you wish to report a bug, it is a
   very good idea to check whether it occurs in this version first ---
   but it is likely to be less stable than the last official release.

Documentation
-------------
You don't need these files if you have all the necessary tools for creating
them from the source distribution (`make everything' in the Doc
subdirectory).

zsh-doc.tar.gz, zsh-doc.tar.bz2
   Pre-built Postscript, Info, DVI and HTML versions of the documentation
   contained in the stable zsh distribution zsh.tar.gz.

zsh-dev-doc.tar.gz, zsh-dev-doc.tar.bz2
   Pre-built Postscript, Info, DVI and HTML versions of the documentation
   contained in the beta zsh distribution zsh-dev.tar.gz.  Only present
   if there has been a development release since the last stable release
   of the shell.

zsh-*-doc.tar.gz, zsh-*-doc.tar.bz2
   Pre-built documentation for specific zsh versions.  See the "old"
   directory for versions other than the latest.
