On My Rocker

Hay guys, with this text I turn over a new leaf. Well, its not really new to me but It mayas well be new to you. The point being is that it is new in some sense, old in others, but in general that it does make rather good enough sense for all those who do read it. When it is said that it is a new leaf, it just means a new peice of paper, thats what turning over a new leaf not exactly obviously means. I did not know that until I read some of John Smiths work. In my time, right now at the present and any time I have been around no one refers to peices of paper as leaves or leafs, the term was depricated. It makes enough sense to me, leaves and papers both are thin sheets that blow in the wind.

Anyway now, the point moves strait forward but there is some curves and gaps here and there, meta text because, what else could it be. This is a digital thread, or unicode string, the content of its characters are intentionally expressed as such.
